This service was presented to us as a savings program for TV, cable and cell phones.   Guaranteeing lower costs on all of these services. Saving you $ on your bills every month.

They did pay my phone off.  Which was a good thing. BUIn the long run you will end up paying much more than that. 
1.  There was no contract presented to you. It was a phone call from owner asking you to agree to certain terms.  They didn't bother to disclose some important info.  
2.   You set up a payment plan of $85.01 per month for the home security system.  No Disclosure that this system 
Was being financed at an interest rate of 9.99% of which you end up paying the interest of $7000 for the first 7 years, then after 7 more years, you start paying the principal for 7 years.

They Bait you with dropping your cable bill, then Switch you to buying an overpriced security system. On Jan 10, 2023, as I left a local grocery store I was approached by a representative of Precision Home Pros,  offering to lower my cable bill. He said they could be at my house in 2 hours to review the options. At my house, they explained how dropping cable and streaming TV instead would save me  $200 a month. I realized later PHP had no special discounts or authority with the internet providers. Any customer could get those deals. BUT, they told me, that PHP's deal included a home security system! This was the first time a security system was mentioned. I now know this was the only reason they were there, to sell me an overpriced security system. They asked me to do a credit app to see if I qualified for this great deal. I was assured, it's just the routine way we do it. They never asked if I needed a loan or would rather pay cash. They never showed a list of equipment that was included or discuss any details of the security system. They insisted on getting it done that night, which meant installing it outside in the dark. After they left, I printed the contract which I eSigned on a mobile phone. I was shocked to see I had signed a loan for $17,000 for 10 years at 9.99% APR for a total payback of $26,000! The plan was, the $200 they saved me monthly by dropping my cable services, would cover the monthly payment for the security system that I did not need. I searched online at a big box retailer and found the exact same Eufy components they had installed for a total of $1,346. A markup of over $15,000! The next morning I delivered a cancellation letter in person and sent them certified mail. I knew in these circumstances Texas law provides a ""3 Day Cool Down Window."" However, the owner is refusing,  saying I can only cancel the alarm monitoring, that I was stuck with the $17,000 loan for the $1,345 of equipment. I uninstalled and returned the equipment. The bank is asking for payment. The bank investigated but PHP told them I did not cancel or return equipment. Not true. Bad business.  I will not pay a dime. PHP needs to refund the money to the bank.",Yelp,1.0,2023-07-08T22:18:18Z,Dave S.,101.0,0.0,3,,OR,App is Not Fraud,The review entered is Fraudulent.,0.063,0.821,0.116,,0.57190305,0.3653029,0.06279408

That is what happened to me.  They pretend that they are saving you money on internet and TV and phones.  The phone service was lousy and you had to get an app to listen to your voice messages.  They said that oh, you will get a security system for the $100 a month you are saving on your other services.  You were not given any contract at the time.  They sent it through email the day after.  If you did not read it within 2 days and cancel it you were paying $9600. For the security system at 9.99 percent interest which means you are paying over $16,000. For a security system that others companies are selling for around $1000.  I was a victim of this scam.  I went to the police but they said that there was no crime involved and they could not help.  I just sold my house and called them to cancel my monthly monitoring, which I was paying $24.64 a month for.  I was told that the contract required 5 years for monitoring and that I owed all of the money for the 5 years plus a $500. Cancellation fee, which came to an additional $1749.44.  I was threatened with breach of contract by Chris, the owner, and he said he would file a lien against me for the whole contract amount even though I had paid off the $9600 the security contract stated was the price.  This company is taking advantage of many people and they need to be stopped.  I hope this will prevent someone else from going through this nightmare.

Over-priced equipment and a contract that is nearly impossible to terminated early. Do your research before signing a contract with Precision Home Pros.

My Father thought he was signing a security contract and ended up with a $7,000 loan. In addition, the contract allows for arbitrary annual rate increase and is written so that you must complete the terms of the contract or pay a huge penalty to break the contract early.

My interactions left me feeling misled and undervalued. While I had hoped for a straightforward and positive experience, it unfortunately did not turn out that way.

From my understanding, the terms of service weren't as clear as I expected. Despite assurances regarding the interest rates and service functionality, my experience did not align with those expectations. The services, including the security system and doorbell, did not meet the level of quality I was led to believe I'd receive. This discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered has led me to advise others to proceed with caution.

It's come to my attention that there might be varying experiences out there, with some individuals having different interactions with this company. In my case, the decision by the loan provider to cease their partnership with this vendor was an eye-opener.

While I've noticed a number of positive reviews, my experiences lead me to wonder about their origins. This is purely my personal skepticism, and I encourage everyone to conduct their own thorough research.

Given what I've gone through, my suggestion to anyone considering this company's services is to document all interactions for your own protection. It's something I wish I had done more diligently. Based on my personal journey, I'm hesitant to recommend this company, but I believe in the importance of making informed decisions based on a wide range of information and sources.

To start they outsource their service work to other companies. Secondly they do not work on the weekends. So if you have any issue with your ac or are in need of service they are available on weekends. The customer service, which is just really one person managing the phone calls rarely answers. When it is time for you to get service, the window of service is anytime between 10am - 7pm with not other types of communication. So you can basically expect to sit in a hot house all day waiting on service.
