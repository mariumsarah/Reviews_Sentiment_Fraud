# Reviews - Sentiment & Fraud

### Objective: Given a file output.csv with a "Review" column. Find the sentiment, Fraud/Not Fraud, Computer Generated/Original Review for each review

### Overview: This project experiments with various implementions of ML Models focused on Sentiment Analysis and Fraud Detection.

### Key Steps: 

1. Add a file output.csv with a column for Reviews. (Refer to my Repo on Webscraping)
2. Run the code to implement 3-4 different models
3. Results are saved in output_fraud4.csv and output_fraud3.csv

Note: Output_fraud3.csv has a model that takes a longer time to train. Comment this code to execute the python script faster.
