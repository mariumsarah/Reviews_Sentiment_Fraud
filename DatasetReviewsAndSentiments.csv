"b""This game is probably my favourite for a couple of reasons. I like that there's no pressure, no deadlines.If you sometimes just feel like relaxing and expanding your cute penguin world, the atmosphere and everything provided by this game is perfect.I play for about 15 min everyday and that's more than enough to enjoy the game and not get bored of it at the same time.I wouldn't say that there are too many ads, they are not pushy, nor annoying. Keep adding cool updates and improving the game! \xf0\x9f\x98\x89""

"b""Used this game for relaxation for 4 month already. And it's great. And the best thing you don't need to pay a penny or waste hours daily even if you want to climb to the very top and build a spaceship. Just calm down wait until ad ends, and use your brain a little to buy things in the right order. Leaders board would be nice.""

"b'This app is more than a six star hotel rating. Its simplifies every electronic communication with its user friendly top notch features. End to end communication encrypted messages did it all. Thumbs up for the developer. Also, see how user can go invincible even when the user is online - this will be highly appreciated. Thank you and God bless.'

"b'it is a very good messaging application and it has more options. It has more information about life It has a chance to get a partner to solve your problem. Good morning \xf0\x9f\x98\x80 It has been a long way in friendship and support to you as well as the rhythm section. I have much time to got it perfect application for messenger'

"b""Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet.""

"b""speechless but I say the most. WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing""

"b""Awesome messenger app. I use it everyday and I must say I really love the simplicity of it. There is one thing I must say and that is the limitations of group chats and their total customisation. I really dislike being restricted on how much letters I can add in a description. Other than that it's amazing""

"b""I love this app . WhatsApp Messenger simply the best I can talk with my contacts when I want. I can video call. Sent text gif and all the things we love to communicate with. It simply the best app. All my friends and family agree it a social belt. Believe me. It just great . Try it you'll see for yourself. Melissa Jones""

"b""I love this app. It allows me to keep in touch with family and friends. It's a little tricky to install and setup, but the picture and sound is great (even in low light which surprised me). I even use it to face to face visit with my Sister in Porto Rico, and that's a long way from Southern California. Love it!""

"b""WhatsApp always works to provide new features. Here I would give my recommendation to get an option where we can create multiple groups to share any particular status and those groups should always be there until we delete it manually. So we don't have to everytime choose contacts to share particular status as per their intrest. For example if we want to show any status to our colleagues We will create a status privacy group once and simply tap on that whenever we want to share status.""
",positive
"b""It is good adding a password or pattern instead only for using fingerprint unlock. If your fingerprint does not work correctly we are not able to unlock the what's app unless we disable the whole fingerprint sensor from device settings. By disabling in this way we want to set the fingerprint newly. To avoid this problem can you add an extra way for unlocking what's app by using any secondary method other than using fingerprint only. In other ways what's app is a best app for messaging.""

"b""I am thankful to WhatsApp team for best social networking app. It's a great conversation app. But It's a humble request to team WhatsApp for being increase timing of status. By the new update status timing is decreased to 15 seconds only,So I request to increase timing to 30 seconds only. Hope team will work for this and for betterment of their application.""

"b""It's a good app but there is something I can't understand. Why is it so hard for the Facebook programmers to make a damn dark mode. It's not so hard, WhatsApp doesn't have too many tabs to cover so why the hell is it taking so damn long. Google made dark mode for the whole damn OS and all of their apps plus apps that aren't theirs and the Facebook team can't make a dark mode for 3 damn tabs?""

"b""Hello Team What's app , Please provide us flash On/Off feature during video calling on Front/Rear camera , If this feature will get us on whatsapp it will be very convenient for us during video chat, we can do video chat in nights clearly without facing any problems. There are many tips and tricks are given on google but we don't want to apply givens tricks. May be this tricks will harm our devices.

"b""This has been the best communicating app out there, you guys upgraded WhatsApp in awesome ways and in that process you made it impossible for people to save one's profile picture instead of asking for it, but then smartphones are smarter, people came up with screenshoting profile pictures since they can't save them. Now may u please create a secure/privacy feature tht blocks screenshots for more security for your users in order to limit such things. Keep up d good work guys Big up\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f""

"b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'

"b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'

Not a reason to rate it low...'

A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation.

It\'s say, ""Download was unable to complete. Check your connection and try again later"". I use WiFi or mobile network 4G (I\'m sure my connection is good), but this happens often.'

"b'Room for improvement: 1)You can not screen mirror a video call to another screen in landscape orientation - it reverts to portrait on the mirrored screen. 2) Forwarding a photo in a chat in whatsapp strips off any text that came with the photo - you have to open the photo and choose share via whatsapp to keep the original text. 3) All metadata is stripped from media sent over whatsapp - keeping the original datetime the media was created would be a help. That said Whatsapp is free and works.'

Kindly add the feature to help put a chat on a scheduler such as a zoom meeting notice...u set a reminder for it without leaving the app 2. It will be great if u could tag some people in your status...rather than always texting the persons to go check ur status'

Very dangerous if you're trying to toggle either top right or left area while driving (driving mode). The whole top bar should be blocked in half to toggle two areas. This is the SOLE REASON I avoid this app and dial in to meetings. Thought new update would address...it didn't.""
